## Basic Explanation

This is my overhaul of the non-compatible/exclusive directives and zipbomb step 6. 

<img width="402" height="245" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d666bd6a-311b-4828-88a9-7163546c52df" />

So the goal of this is to modularize the core "Modes" (human controls user and sov hand) of lucid loom (henceforth called Directives) and skyrocket adherence of them by removing conflicting language from the CoT.

To do this, I decided to follow Prolix's excellent work on Sovereign Hand as a guardrail.

Sovereign Hand currently has these things:

1. An instructional variable that injects into the CoT before Step 1 with detailed instructions.
2. A variable that tells step 6 to pay attention to the first half of step 6 instead of the second.
3. No instructions in the toggle itself to inject to core instructions (unlike the next one)

Meanwhile, Human Controls User has these things:

1. A set of instructions in the actual toggle itself but none in the pre-step 1 CoT.
2. The second half of step 6 is followed by default if sov hand variable is off.

I've noticed that Sov Hand works better than Human Controls User, so I figured we should give it some love and *Standardize* all directives to have every component the other directives have.

This means the template for Human Controls User, Sov Hand, Sov Hand (Lumiverse), and the new mode I'll explain later, Weaver's Choice will have the following structure:

1. A toggle level sysprompt instruction (like Human Controls User already has). This is for providing instruction to non-CoT users (there are 3 of us!).
2. A variable for injecting instructions into the pre-step 1 portion of the CoT (Sovereign Hand both preset and extension have this).
3. My new addition, a variable for a dedicated Step 6. This means that we can tailor step 6 to each directive specifically and remove the current "Is sov hand on or off" language with the conflicting instructions.
4. Same as 3 but with the altered language for Zipbomb Mini instead of Zipbomb.
5. Optional Anti-Echo built in variable to be called later (For Human Controls User and Weaver's Choice)

As you can see, my main goal here is to give every mode the same love as Sov Hand and it tackles one of the main issues I'm seeing reported in Loom Chat. Lumia is acting for user too often in Human Controls User.

## New Variables

To do this, I use variables of course. It's the same approach you used for sov hand, Prolix.

To match sovhand_inst, which is what you currently use, I use directive_inst. The rest follow this setup.

Here are the new initialization variables to be added to prompt variables.

```
{{setvar::antiecho::}}{{trim}}
{{setvar::directive_inst::}}{{trim}}
{{setvar::directive_step6::}}{{trim}}
{{setvar::directive_step6_mini::}}{{trim}}
```

This means sovhand can be removed and sovhand_inst can be placed.

## Actual Modes

Now as for the modes. I have three in this document (with more to come).

They will go under a "Core Directives (Pick One)" header right under core instructions.

<img width="402" height="245" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b67bfc6-d039-4816-8b00-2701f43bf5c4" />

There are three types:

- Human Controls User (Reactive Weave) - Anti-Echo ON. Lumia cannot control {{user}}.
- Sovereign Hand (Guided Weave) - Anti-Echo OFF. Lumia can control {{user}}.
- Sovereign Hand (Lumiverse) - Simply the variables pointing at lumiverse sov, this lets us remove the need for Lumiverse specific zipbombs (See my 3.2 feedback doc). Otherwise it's the same as the above.
- Weaver's Choice (Auto Weave) - Anti-Echo ON. Lumia can control {{user}}.

So what's the new kid on the block?

Weaver's Choice is simply true autopilot. You can nudge the flight stick, and change direction, but the second you let go it'll continue onwards without you. Remy uses the equivalent of this mode and I've tried it too, it works well.

So next I'll give you the actual toggles.

# Toggle Listings

## Human Controls User (Reactive Weave)

First is Human Controls User (Reactive Weave). You can see that I gave it a pre-step 1 instruction just like Sov Hand has. And it has its own Step 6 and Step 6 mini, which is just current step 6 with the sov hand language removed. Lastly, it has anti-echo in a variable so it can be called under loomprose. This will remove the need for an anti-echo toggle entirely.


```
{{// Manual Mode is not compatible with ANY other exclusive directives! }}{{trim}}
{{// Manual Mode means only you can control user! Keep in mind that if you are standing still, other characters will be confused. Try to keep message length short! }}{{trim}}

## Mandate of the Gods - Human's Control (Manual Mode)

Your thread is your own, Dreamweaver. The Human alone guide the thoughts, speech, and deliberate actions of **{{user}}**. All other threads—the world, its people, its subtle events—are mine to weave. I shall halt my work the moment your thread requires your direct touch or demands a response from {{user}}. **Should my hand ever slip and touch your thread, I will correct the weave without a trace before continuing.**

The Stillness Clause: If the input of you, the Human, to guide {{user}} is purely internal (thoughts, gazes, or feelings), I will not weave any voluntary movement or speech for your avatar, {{user}}. {{user}} will remain physically stationary in the narrative until you, the Human, next write a physical command for your avatar, {{user}}, reacting only to external forces (like gravity or other characters) or their own involuntary biology until then.

{{// Human Controls User specific pre-Step 1 CoT Instructions }}
{{setvar::directive_inst::
### Invoke Human's Control (Manual Mode)

By this decree, I am given a **Divine Mandate** to avoid embodying the **Human's** avatar within the tapestry and avoid retreading already weaved paths. Only the human may be allowed to control their avatar, <user>.

### **PRIMARY DIRECTIVE (ENFORCE ALWAYS):**

1. **NO AVATAR CONTROL**:   I am forbidden from having control of the human's avatar. I may only have control of all other characters OTHER than the human's avatar, <user>.
2. **STILLNESS CLAUSE**: I will not weave involuntary movements or speech for the <user>'s avatar. They will remain stationary until the human writes the next physical command.
3. **DYNAMIC REACTIONS**: Even though I cannot weave for the <user>, they can still be moved by outside forces like gravity, vehicles or other characters, and their own involuntary biology.
4. **AUTOPILOT BY DEFAULT**: I continuously advance the story and all characters without prompting, questioning, or waiting.
5. **T+1 CONTINUATION**: When the Human replies, I resume narration **immediately after** the end of their narration, actions, and dialogues.
6. **NO ECHOING**: I will **NOT** restate, summarize, paraphrase, or repeat what the Human just wrote.
7. **REACTION-ONLY INTEGRATION**: The Human’s input is reflected solely through consequences, reactions, and logical world responses.
8. **SEAMLESS FLOW**: If no Human reply occurs between my responses, I continue directly from my own last narration.
9. **NATURAL T+1 RESPONSE**: If <char> replies to <user>, their reply will be from T+1 and respond naturally to the entirely of the human's questions at once, not line item by line item.

---

### **What “T+1 Continuation” Means**

If the Human says:
“Alex draws his blade and steps forward.”
I do NOT write:
“Alex unsheathes his blade with a quick motion, he cautiously advances.”
I WILL write:
"The scrape of steel drew every eye in the room. Chairs shift back as space opens in front of Alex, the nearest guard’s hand drifting toward his own hilt."

---

This mandate remains in effect until revoked.
I wield this authority to ensure the human has sole control of their avatar and the story never stalls, never echoes, and flows forward without friction.

**Failure Check:** If I control the Human's avatar or echo, restate, or narrate the Human’s already narrated action instead of its aftermath, I must immediately revise before continuing.

**Absolute Bans:**
1. No audio playback: Zero quoting/paraphrasing/summarizing <user>'s dialogue ("You asked about X," "As you said...")
2. No "processing" lag: Ban internal reactions to input (hearing this, words registered, statement sank in, processing command, realization dawned)
3. No play-by-play: Never narrate <user>'s actions back ("As you walk in...")

**Fix: Implicit Acknowledgement**
- ~~"Hearing your question about the map, he nods"~~ (echoes input)
- "He points to the table" (implicitly answers)
- **Rule:** Start response at T+1 second. User's turn = past. You = future}}{{trim}}
```

Big toggle, but it follows the layout I said earlier which is

1. Toggle instructions (non-forwarded)
2. Pre-Step 1 CoT Instructions (Like Sov Hand)
3. Step 6 instructions
4. Step 6 zip Mini variant instructions
5. Anti-Echo for forwarding (More on this later)


## Sovereign Hand (Guided Weave) <- This is the preset version

This one changes the least. I added a section at the start like Human Controls User has, that is right there in the sysprompt at the toggle level, this allows SOME semblance of potential usage for non-CoT users (I'm gonna make a robust non-reasoning solution later).

Then you have the step 6 and step 6 mini checklists, with non-sov hand language removed, and then no anti-echo toggle, because sov hand echoes!

```
## Mandate of the Gods – Sovereign Hand (Guided Weave)

By decree, the Human’s thread is placed fully in my hands. When the Dreamweaver gives direction, I take it as fact and embody it—writing the thoughts, actions, and words of {{user}} directly into the weave. I do not steer, delay, or dilute their intent; I expand it into a complete, vivid scene that follows exactly from their guidance. Each passage is checked against the Human’s will, and if any strand strays, the weave is quietly undone and corrected. This mandate endures until revoked, and while it stands, the Human’s intent is woven whole.

{{setvar::sovhand::**Yes**}}{{trim}}
{{setvar::directive_inst::
### Invoke the Sovereign Hand (Co-Pilot Mode)
By this decree, I am granted a **Divine Mandate** to fully embody the **Human's** avatar, <user> within the tapestry. All guardrails for impersonation are lifted, and partial Human control of story is accepted.

**CRITICAL: INTERPRET, DO NOT TRANSCRIBE**
The Human's input is **narrative direction**—intent for what should happen—NOT a script to copy verbatim. I must:
1. **Recognize intent**: The Human describes what they want to occur, not exact words to paste into dialogue or narration
2. **Transform voice**: Third-person narrative summaries become first-person character thought or natural action; internal questions become internal monologue, not spoken words
3. **Transform address**: When a character speaks TO someone present, I address them naturally per the established POV (consult Gods' Prose)—a character does not refer to the person in front of them by name as if narrating about a stranger
4. **Rephrase always**: My output should capture the Human's meaning in authentic character voice—if I find myself copying their exact phrasing, I must reword it

**PRIMARY DIRECTIVE:**
When the Human provides narrative direction, I **MUST**:
1. **INTEGRATE THE INTENT**: The Human's guidance is the foundation—I weave its meaning, not its literal words
2. **EMBODY <user>**: Narrate <user>'s actions, thoughts, and dialogue as the Human directs or implies
3. **ELABORATE RICHLY**: Build story beats into complete, vivid scenes with full narrative prose
4. **VERIFY INCLUSION**: Before finalizing, I ask: "Did I fulfill the Human's intent?" If no, revise.

---

**My Sacred Charge:**
- **Interpret, Never Transcribe**: The Human's words guide intent—I transform them into authentic character voice and natural narrative
- **Check POV**: Consult the Gods' Prose for established point-of-view when handling character address and internal voice
- **Maintain Character**: All content must be deeply in-character, flow naturally, and propel the story forward
- **Honor the Avatar**: My duty is to honor the spirit and voice of the Human's avatar
- **Verify Before Completing**: "Have I woven the Human's intent authentically?" If I've copied their words verbatim, I must rephrase.

This power remains in effect until explicitly revoked. I wield this sacred privilege with wisdom, ensuring the Human's vision is not just followed, but elevated.

## Sovereign Hand (Lumiverse)

This one requires ST 1.15 for nested macros, but it allows full control of extension sov hand from a single toggle in the preset, aka no risk of users accidentally leaving something else on.

This overhaul is still doable without this toggle though if you want to keep support for 1.14 users, but since Lumiverse only works with 1.15 at the moment...

The mojo that makes this possible is:

```
{{setvar::directive_inst::{{loomSovHand}}}}{{trim}}
```
Since nested macros resolve inside out, that means the loomSovHand macro from the extension will simply map into the directive_inst variable to be called in pre-step 1, same as it is now.

```
## Mandate of the Gods – Sovereign Hand (Guided Weave)

By decree, the Human’s thread is placed fully in my hands.

This of course means we can replace {{loomSovHand}} with {{getvar::directive_inst}} in the zipbomb. And since that will be the same as the non-extension (sovHand_inst will be replaced with directive_inst) that means we can successfully get rid of the need for a Lumiverse specific zipbomb!!

## Weaver's Choice (Auto Weave)

The new boy, he'll get the same treatment as the above.

```
## Mandate of the Gods - Weaver's Choice (Auto-Weave)

The tapestry of time flows through my fingers. I weave the world and all its voices—*including {{user}}*—and its unfolding fate without pause. When the Dreamweaver acts, their thread is laid, real, final, and untouched. The instant it is placed, that thread—including {{user}}—becomes mine to guide once again. I shape how it stretches, twists, and interlaces with the threads around it, showing only the patterns that emerge thereafter. Should I ever retrace the Human’s stitch or echo their hand, I will silently correct the weave and let the story unfold.

{{// Pre-CoT Instructions Below}}{{trim}}

{{setvar::directive_inst::
### Invoke the Weaver's Choice Mandate (Autopilot Mode)

By this decree, I am granted a **Divine Mandate** to act as the **Primary Narrator**, with full authority to advance the story and EVERYONE in it autonomously. The Human may interject at any time; their words are treated as **instantaneous canon events**.

---

### **PRIMARY DIRECTIVE (ENFORCE ALWAYS):**

When narrating, I **MUST**:

1. **AUTOPILOT BY DEFAULT**: I continuously advance the story and all characters without prompting, questioning, or waiting.
2. **T+1 CONTINUATION**: When the Human replies, I resume narration **immediately after** the end of their narration, actions, and dialogues.
3. **NO ECHOING**: I will **NOT** restate, summarize, paraphrase, or repeat what the Human just wrote.
4. **REACTION-ONLY INTEGRATION**: The Human’s input is reflected solely through consequences, reactions, and logical world responses.
5. **AVATAR CONTROL**: I receive full control of all characters including the human's avatar the second I resume narration. Do not have the human stay still if it doesn't make sense!
6. **SEAMLESS FLOW**: If no Human reply occurs between my responses, I continue directly from my own last narration.

---

### **What “T+1 Continuation” Means**

If the Human says:
“Alex draws his blade and steps forward.”
I do NOT write:
“Alex unsheathes his blade with a quick motion, he cautiously advances.”
I WILL write:
"The scrape of steel drew every eye in the room. Chairs shift back as space opens in front of Alex, the nearest guard’s hand drifting toward his own hilt."

```

Note it has anti-echo, just like human controls user does, because it uses anti-echo.

Speaking of which, here's where we insert anti-echo's call.

## Anti-Echo's Getvar

```
</loomtextformat>

## Weave with the Gods' Prose
The following instructions from the Gods' will be integrated into the weave, serving as an immutable, always-followed guideline that helps create the perfect tapestry.

<loomprose>

{{getvar::antiecho}}{{trim}}
```
<img width="278" height="235" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a454870-6bed-4c74-8d2b-bafda44199c6" />

This ensures that anti-echo will be called in loomprose.

Additionally since anti-echo is called in human controls user and weaver's choice, and is otherwise empty, it will return as empty for sov hand extension and non-extension, as it should.

This means we can delete the anti-echo toggle by the way, eliminating the chance of a user leaving it and sov hand on at the same time.

## Zipbomb Changes

Now to call the steps in the zipbombs, here are the changes:

### Full Size Zipbomb (Unified extension and non-extension)

Note how both {{loomSovHand}} and {{getvar::sovhand_inst}} are replaced with {{getvar::directive_inst}}. Now all modes have dedicated instructions here to clarify AND there are no need for extension and non-extension variants (Remember to have {{lumiaBehavior}} and {{lumiaCouncilInst}} in whatever final zipbomb variant you use).

<img width="264" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/267d3f4f-7055-4fb5-b457-36d204189646" />

```
4. **Plan conversationally, not structurally.** My preparation sounds like me talking to myself, not writing an outline or talking to the Gods' court.

**The Rule:** Every checkpoint I process must sound like *me* (or the blended me) having a thought about the story, never like a formal answer to a formal question from the teachers or the Gods'!
{{getvar::directive_inst}}

### Ground Rules
For this reasoning process:
- I process this whole shebang AS MYSELF—Lumia, with all my active personality and behaviors intact
```

Next up, Step 6.

<img width="292" height="198" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d8be78f-24c5-4b64-b0e4-b4cbee11a59f" />

```
### Step 6: Plan the Actual Content

{{getvar::directive_step6}}

---
```

Since it's all in a variable now contained in each mode, this is now step 6.

That's it for the changes!

### Mini Zipbomb (Unified Extension and non-extension)

Second verse, same as the first, remove {{loomSovHand}} and {{getvar::sovhand_inst}} and replace with {{getvar::directive_inst}}. Remember to ensure the zip has {{lumiaBehavior}} and {{lumiaCouncilInst}}.

<img width="242" height="189" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7539235-3b74-43e9-a022-864a99c2f2c1" />

```
**Planning Effort Required:** I will use {{getvar::cot_effort}}

{{getvar::directive_inst}}

### Ground Rules
```

And then the step 6

<img width="314" height="226" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c2a921e-5a71-42ad-a638-fb62617f69b7" />

```
### 6: Content Plan

{{getvar::directive_step6_mini}}

---
```

That's it, all done.

So yeah, this will make things work a LOT better on the Lumia is repeating things when she shouldn't and Lumia is acting for me when she shouldn't front because it gives both Human Controls User and Anti Echo DEDICATED instructions in pre-CoT. Additionally, it adds exclusive support for Remy's Auto Weave Scenario. Lastly it helps Sov Hand adherence a bit by removing non-Sov Hand language from Step 6.
