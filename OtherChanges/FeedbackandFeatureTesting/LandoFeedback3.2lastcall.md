# Feedback for 3.2 Last Call

## CoT Feedback

### Both New and Old

#### All Zipbombs Missing 'loomutils' tag on the end of Step 11.

Also missing the stuff after it, but I don't think you'd add those.

### New Zip Betas

#### Missing 1.5 OOC steps and misplaced Bunnymo OOC

The following Zip Betas are missing the 1.5 OOC Step even though ooc was removed from pre-step 1, and still have the bunnymo step left in the pre-step 1 for some reason.

CoT Zip Beta (Lumiverse Sov Hand)
Reasoner Zipbomb Beta

Additionally, the assistant zipbomb also haven't had OOC moved to step 1.5
CoT Zipbomb (Assistant)

#### Wrong Sov Hand trigger yes/no trigger in some lumiverse zips

Uses getvar version of sov hand on/off instead of Lumiverse one.

### Switch Steps 6 and 7

The following Zipbombs have not had their steps 6 and 7 switched yet:
CoT Zipbomb (System)
CoT Zipbomb (Lumiverse Sov Hand)
Reasoner Zipbomb (System)
CoT Zipbomb (Assistant)


### Missing Loom Council Instructions

{{loomCouncilInst}} is missing from:

CoT Zipbomb Beta
CoT Zipbomb (System)
CoT Zipbomb (Lumiverse Sov Hand)
Reasoner Zipbomb (System)
Reasoner Zipbomb Beta

They do have the extension's {{lumiaBehavior}}, so I'm guessing this is an oversight.

# Recommendations

## Move CoT Selections (System)

I recommend moving CoT Selections (System) category to be after Zipbomb so people don't think those are the best/default options. We've had several new people assuming CoT Normal is the best in the channel lately.
