# Feedback for 3.2 Last Call

## CoT Feedback

### Both New and Old

#### Missing 'loomutils' tag on the end.

Also missing the stuff after it, but I don't think you'd add those.

### New Zip Betas

#### Missing 1.5 OOC steps

Zip Beta has the new 1.5 OOC section, but Zip Beta Lumi Sov and Reasoner Zip Beta are both missing it. They all had the zips moved out of the pre-step 1, which means lumi sov beta and reasoner zip beta are both missing any ooc handling whatsoever.

#### Wrong Sov Hand trigger yes/no trigger in some lumiverse zips

Uses getvar version of sov hand on/off instead of Lumiverse one.

### Old Zips

Old style zipbombs never had their steps 6 and 7 switched.
