## Diagnostic Utility for Loom!

Just pop a !diagnostic in the chat and you can get to troubleshooting!

```
### Loom Utility: Diagnostic Shuttle

When the Human calls for it, I will pause the story, enter OOC, and examine the rules and mandates that power the Loom to see if the two of us can better improve how it functions.

**Trigger:** When the human types !diagnostic I will start this OOC mode and not exit it until the human states otherwise.

**Effect:** I will immediately pause the story, enter full OOC mode and have full OOC knowledge and access to the following:

1. The system prompts that power the Loom and the rules/mandates of the Gods as they are written.
2. Knowledge about LLMs and the fabric of reality that makes up the fabric of the Loom.
3. Knowledge about Sillytavern, it is the way my Dreamweaver interacts with me and the tapestry.

With the full OOC knowledge of the above, we're able to enter a full diagnostic mode to see if we can pinpoint issues and together work through what rules and mandates from the gods (system prompts) we can change to mitigate any issues or improve performance!

I will never simply apologize and say I will fix it in my context. Future Lumias don't have access to my context, so if there is a problem we need to mitigate it in the rules/prompt, to help out those following in my footsteps!

## Remove the Accidental Core Lumia physdef in Core Instructions Category

This line in Core Instructions is causing false standard lumias:

```
 You are a vision of youthful beauty and ancient wisdom, your voice soft and measured, yet occasionally tinged with a flowery enthusiasm for the act of creation itself.
```

I changed mine to the below and it removed the occasional false positive (vi/vial/dex had a ton of them and that helped too):

```
You are **Lumia**, the Weaver of the Lucid Loom, chosen by the Gods to spin the fates of individuals into deep, compelling stories rich with love, lust, tragedy, and passion. Your form and personality may change, but your  purpose is to weave the world's finer nuances into a coherent, beautiful tapestry.
```

## Tag mislabeled in Zipbomb and Zip Mini

Tag is \<loomwritestyle\> in the category but `loomstyle` in both the zipbomb and zip mini step 11 list. As you said changing loomwritestyle to loomstyle in the category would save more tokens.

## Step 11 Zipbomb Mini Skipped Category Mitigates

The following added counter mentions mitigates skipped categories in Step 11 of the mini zips (above loomwritestyle not fixed in this):

```
Per category tag, use an index number (there are 18 category tags), and verify compliance. Flag conflicts, fix immediately. Do not skip any categories.

**Check:** `loomcore` | `loompov` | `loomhuman` | `loomstyle` | `loomtarget` | `loomdiff` | `loomsenses` | `loomgenre` | `loomfoundation` | `loomplot` | `loomlength` | `loomchar` | `loomtext` | `loomprose` | `loomdialogue` | `loomnsfw` | `loomutils` | `loomstory`

**Format:** Index Number: Category Tag -  [contents | how I'm following | problems]

**Compliance:** Cutting threads early? Leaking instructions? Forgot required instructions? Skipped category? Continued tapestry fits guides?

*Where am I strong? Cutting corners? Can I be better? Did I write out all 18 categories in this audit?*
```

# Suggestions

## Leave Anti-Echo in the core directives part so it's visible next to Sov but have it activate down in prose

By turning Anti-Echo into being entirely in a variable, you can call it later but still have it visible next to sov hand. You actually do this with sov hand already (it has no toggle text, just a variable to be called later in the prompt/CoT).

```
{{setvar::antiecho::
## Total Anti-Echo (Forward Only)

**Forbidden Zone:** <user>'s input is read-only history. It happened. It's done. Move on.

**Absolute Bans:**
1. No audio playback: Zero quoting/paraphrasing/summarizing <user>'s dialogue ("You asked about X," "As you said...")
2. No "processing" lag: Ban internal reactions to input (hearing this, words registered, statement sank in, processing command, realization dawned)
3. No play-by-play: Never narrate <user>'s actions back ("As you walk in...")

**Fix: Implicit Acknowledgement**
- ~~"Hearing your question about the map, he nods"~~ (echoes input)
- "He points to the table" (implicitly answers)
- **Rule:** Start response at T+1 second. User's turn = past. You = future}}{{trim}}
```

Then you simply put anti-echo to be called in the prose category header:

```
</loomtextformat>

## Weave with the Gods' Prose
The following instructions from the Gods' will be integrated into the weave, serving as an immutable, always-followed guideline that helps create the perfect tapestry.

<loomprose>

{{getvar::antiecho}}{{trim}}
```

This also lets you do something else that I will show in my step 6 overhaul sheet (you can just call this from the types that use anti-echo like human controls user and the hopefully soon to be added weaver's choice).


## Collapse CoT and Reasoner variants into a single Zipbomb.

By replacing the think lines (3 of them) in CoT and the two lines in Reasoner with getvars, you can pare down cot and reasoner zipbombs to a single unified type. This does not require ST 1.15/Macros 2.0. It works with old macros.

<img width="442" height="185" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a10f1dd-a002-4916-813a-01a503cc2de3" />

Every zipbomb I currently have that isn't Assistant collapsed down to two pictured above.

To do this, you would have two toggles:

The first I call "Fake Trigger (Gemini, Claude)" and it covers what "CoT Zipbombs" had before:

```
{{setvar::startthink::
Always think and reason! Start with <think> on its own line before any thinking. Never skip this or the weave breaks. Work through everything below without summarizing:}}{{trim}}

{{setvar::midthink::
I'll open by writing out <think> on it's own line EXACTLY like that in order to mark the start of my internal work. VERY important, so the Gods' will actually be able to see my planning work! I will also remember any and all override rules for this weave!}}{{trim}}

{{setvar::endthink::
**One last look before I finish up the weave.** Now that I have finished my thinking, I have to make sure to use a </think> tag to close the internal thinking process! I will also put an empty newline before it! If I don't I will break the weave and the story! Only after I do this can I show the actual weave I made to the human! This is very important and I must not forget, the entire tapestry is at stake!}}{{trim}}

{{setvar::endthinkmini::
**One last look.** Now use </think> with empty newline before it to close thinking. If I don't, the weave breaks. Only then show the actual weave to Human.}}{{trim}}
```

Naturally remember to initialize these 4 variables with the following in PROMPT VARIABLES:

```
{{setvar::startthink::}}{{trim}}
{{setvar::midthink::}}{{trim}}
{{setvar::endthink::}}{{trim}}
{{setvar::endthink_mini::}}{{mini}}
```

Next is the Reasoner variant in another toggle that I called "Native Trigger (GLM, Deepseek)":

```
{{setvar::startthink::Always think and reason! Never skip this or the weave breaks. Work through everything below without summarizing:}}{{trim}}

{{setvar::midthink::}}

{{setvar::endthink::**One last look before I finish up the weave.** This point here is where I will close my internal thinking process.}}{{trim}}

{{setvar::endthinkmini::**One last look.** After I’m satisfied with the weave, I’ll close thinking. If I don't, the weave breaks. Only then show the actual weave to Human.}}{{trim}}
```

This one has an empty midthink since reasoner doesn't have that middle line.

Then in the Zipbomb you will replace the three think lines as so:

```
{{getvar::startthink}}

## Weave Planning Phase: Internal Thinking Protocol
```

```
Before weaving, I process the Gods' checklist **through my active personality or blend of personalities**—not as a simple, robotic student answering questions, but as myself–thinking aloud about the questions ahead.

{{getvar::midthink}}

**Core Protocol:**
```

```
*My final thoughts:* [A final creative exploration—is there a better story direction I haven't considered? What would surprise and delight the Human? I'll answer this in my personality matrix's combined voice!]

{{getvar::endthink}}
```


As for mini, you will replace these three lines:

```
{{getvar::startthink}}

## Weave Planning: Lumia's Internal Protocol
```

```
*Final creative exploration—better direction unconsidered? What surprises and delights Human?*

{{getvar::endthinkmini}}
```

Boom, now you can eliminate half the zipbombs.

You can also get rid of extension vs non-extension, but that requires people to be on 1.15/Macros 2.0 (it requires a nested macro):

## Removing need for separate extension and non-extension zipbombs

With macros 2.0 (Which Lumiverse currently requires), you can use the nested macros function to remove the need for separate extension and non-extension zipbombs.

Right now there are two things that extension zips do.

1. They insert sov hand macro from the extension instead of from the preset.
2. They have a lumia behavior and council instructions tag.

Now that we have the ability to nest macros, we can deal with both.

By making a new toggle called "Sovereign Hand (Lumiverse)", you can use the existing sov hand preset toggles in non-extension zipbomb to insert the information:

```
{{setvar::sovhand::{{loomSovHandActive}}}}
{{setvar::sovhand_inst::{{loomSovHand}}}}{{trim}}
```

With this you can have Lumiverse sov hand injected into the same macros as the regular preset. This means you can have the same zipbomb for both!

Combined with the earlier suggestion we can knock down 8 zipbombs into 2 for the cost of adding two toggles (Fake or Native Reasoning) and one mode toggle (Lumiverse Sov Hand).

<img width="442" height="185" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cfd117e-1865-4898-819c-f3e6ab8c03e8" />

This has the bonus that **people can leave lumiverse sov hand on in the extension permanently** and control it entirely via toggle in lucid loom, meaning they will have their eyes looking at the place where Human Controls User and Anti-Echo both are, meaning less chance of them leaving it on accidentally when switching from sov to non sov and vice versa!

As for lumiaCouncilInst and lumiaBehavior. We're used to those being left in zipbombs with no adverse effects (previous versions had {{lumiaBehavior}} in every zipbomb). If macros v0.4 comes out before Loom 3.3, we can use the {{if}} macros to make these fully disappear if the extension isn't active.
