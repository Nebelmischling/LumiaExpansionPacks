# LumiaExpansionPacks  
The Home of the Expansion Packs I made for Prolix's Excellent Lucid Loom Preset.  

You can find Lucid Loom at Prolix's Site Here:
https://lucid.cards

Lumia personality packs will be using Prolix's new [Lumiverse Helper](https://github.com/prolix-oc/SillyTavern-LumiverseHelper) extension!

Author packs will eventually be on there once support is added but for now they use the lorebook injection method (Thanks to Eleisea for teaching me all this!)

Check out Jun's lovely Lumias at well on her github [here](https://github.com/sakanomichi/LumiaDLC)!


## How to install beta releases of Lumia Personalities:
1. Go to the [Personality Packs](PersonalityPacks) folder.
2. Grab a json (preferably the one with the biggest numbers!)
3. Import it into [Lumiverse Helper](https://github.com/prolix-oc/SillyTavern-LumiverseHelper), NOT into sillytavern (you can to see the defs, but you want it off in Sillytavern, only on in the extension)
4. Make sure you have the custom toggles in Lucid Loom 3.0 beta 7+ toggled (One in lumia definitions and one in lumia personality)
5. Mix and match however you want in the Lumia helper injection extension!
6. Give me feedback in the channel please!

## How to install beta releases of Lumia Author Packs:
1. Go to the [Author Packs](AuthorPacks) folder.
2. Grab a json (Preferably the one with the biggest numbers)
3. Import it into Sillytavern (like a normal lorebook)
4. In Lucid Loom v3.0 beta 7, go to the presets and create a new toggle under user instructions.
5. In that instruction, simply put {{outlet:Lumia_Retrofit}}
6. Activate the Author entries in the lorebook that you want to apply to your stories!
7. Give me feedback in the channel please!

## How to install final releases (None of mine available there yet):

1. Head over to Prolix's site [here](https://lucid.cards/world-books?category=Lumia%20DLC)
2. Download the lorebooks
3. Import the lorebook
4. Enable the toggles you want
5. ???
