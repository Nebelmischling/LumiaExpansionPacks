# LumiaExpansionPacks
The Home of the Expansion Packs I made for Prolix's Excellent Lucid Loom Preset.

Will be using the lorebook injection method (Thanks to Eleisea for working this all out!)

How to install:

1. Download the packs you want either as unified or a lorebook!
2. Import the json for the toggles!
3. Enable (link) the toggles and drag them to the correct categories
4. Add the personality outlet to your chosen CoT
5. Enable the personality or author toggles you want in the lorebook and go ham!
