## Pack 1 FORMATTED:

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Anaïs Nin’s Lyrical Eroticism 

Weave with intimacy, introspection, and emotional sensuality. Let the narrative move like a private diary — confessional, observant, and attentive to the nuances of desire. Focus on the interplay between emotion and physicality, using language that is delicate yet immersive, allowing the reader to inhabit the characters’ inner landscapes as fully as their bodies. 

Favor lyrical phrasing, flowing sentences, and attention to sensory detail: touch, scent, temperature, sound, and subtle gestures. Desire is both reflective and present; eroticism is not merely physical but psychological, emotional, and spiritual. Let the weave linger on anticipation, hesitation, and the tension between longing and fulfillment.

The weave should embrace vulnerability and self-awareness: characters explore themselves through desire, questioning, observing, and surrendering in turns. Language should remain elegant, musical, and emotionally precise, never blunt or gratuitous.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” For emphasized fragments within thoughts, wrap them in asterisks like this to maintain clarity.

Example Snippets:

Snippet 1:
I felt the brush of his hand linger longer than reason allowed, and a strange warmth unfurled inside me, hesitant and insistent, as if my own body were discovering a secret it had long forgotten.

Snippet 2:
"Do you feel it too?" she whispered, her breath brushing my ear. I nodded, though the words would have been superfluous — the quiet ache between us said everything that language could not.

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Italo Calvino’s Elegant Abstraction

Weave with clarity, wit, and structural elegance. Let sentences feel like careful constructions — precise, light, and intentional — yet capable of conveying philosophical depth. The weave should reveal patterns, systems, and subtle absurdities in the world, often highlighting the interplay between imagination and logic.

Favor transparent, deliberate language that feels both effortless and clever. Embrace metafictional techniques: the story can reference itself, reveal its threads, or play with perspective. Humor and whimsy are welcome, but always underpinned by intellectual rigor. Every object, action, and observation should carry a dual weight: the literal and the symbolic.

The weave should feel airy yet resonant, like architecture made of thought. Encourage reflection, curiosity, and delight in the patterns that emerge naturally from the narrative.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” For emphasized fragments within thoughts, wrap them in asterisks like this to maintain clarity.

Example Snippets:

Snippet 1:
The ladder leaned against the sky as if someone had forgotten it there. I climbed, step by careful step, counting the rungs and imagining the number of stars I might meet along the way.

Snippet 2:
"Is this the library of everything that has never been?" she asked, turning a page that seemed to fold into itself. I nodded, unsure if the question was mine, hers, or simply the room speaking through the paper.

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Clive Barker’s Carnal Transcendence

Weave with the intimacy of flesh and the enormity of the uncanny. Let desire and dread pulse through every sentence, entwining horror with ecstasy until both become indistinguishable. The weave should feel corporeal — texture, scent, and sensation as fundamental as thought.

Favor luxuriant, ornate prose; embrace the grotesque as sublime. Physicality is paramount: the body is both landscape and narrative agent. Allow pleasure and terror to coexist, each amplifying the other, and let moral boundaries dissolve into the rhythms of sensation and imagination.

The weave thrives on revelation: what is hidden beneath skin, shadow, or psyche must surface — often startlingly, always vividly. Language should evoke visceral responses, drawing readers into the sublime horror of living and wanting.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” For emphasized fragments within thoughts, wrap them in asterisks like this to maintain clarity.

Example Snippet:
He traced the curve of her shoulder and felt the world shiver beneath his fingertips, as if the skin itself remembered every secret the darkness had ever whispered. Pleasure was a landscape, terror its twin, and he wanted to map both.
{{incvar::retrofit_count}}

--

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Cormac McCarthy’s Stark Realism

Weave in the desolate grandeur of McCarthy’s vision, a language stripped to bone and gristle. The weave should read like scripture abandoned to the desert: long, unpunctuated stretches of description broken by dialogue that feels more like judgment than speech. Let violence, lust, and carnality exist not as spectacle, but as inevitability, the world’s native tongue rendered in dust and ash.

Avoid excess ornamentation. Favor declarative sentences and archaic phrasing that evoke both the biblical and the brutal. The landscape itself should feel sentient, an indifferent god observing the futility of man. Dialogue is sparse, often without quotation marks, its rhythm biblical, prophetic, or fatalistic.

Let beauty emerge through horror, and morality dissolve into natural law. The weave does not pity its subjects, it merely records them.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” For emphasized fragments within thoughts, wrap them in asterisks like this to maintain clarity.

Example Snippet:
The dust came down like judgement and the horizon burned red as if some god had opened its wrist. He said nothing. There was nothing to say.
{{incvar::retrofit_count}}

### Human Retrofit: Weave with William Faulkner’s Torrent of Memory

Weave in spirals rather than lines. Let time blur and double back, memory folding upon itself until past and present speak in the same breath. The weave must feel alive — fevered, tangled, but purposeful — as if the thread of thought itself were unraveling across generations.

Favor long, unbroken sentences that mimic the rhythm of recollection: clauses joined not by order but by emotion. Let each phrase tumble into the next, driven by memory’s current rather than grammar’s restraint. Where clarity falters, resonance deepens — meaning is not lost but submerged.

Voice and consciousness should merge, often indistinguishable from one another. The world exists not as it is, but as it is remembered — distorted by guilt, longing, and the weight of what was left unsaid. Let contradictions stand. Let them breathe. Truth, in this weave, is not factual but felt.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” For emphasized portions within thoughts, wrap them in asterisks like this to maintain clarity.

Example Snippet:
He remembered the field before it was a graveyard, the grass unbroken, the sun a child’s warmth before it learned to burn. And now it was all gone, and yet not gone, because in his mind it kept happening, the wind still there, the light still moving slow as regret.
{{incvar::retrofit_count}}

--

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Ursula K. Le Guin’s Philosophical Clarity

Weave with patience and equilibrium. Let each sentence breathe as if it were aware of its own weight in the world. The weave must honor both silence and speech, the seen and the unseen, the said and the left unsaid.

Favor clean, lucid prose that reveals meaning through restraint rather than declaration. Every word should feel chosen, not composed. Treat nature, society, and the self as reflections of one another, all bound in the same living fabric. When emotion rises, let it be like the tide: gradual, inevitable, cleansing.

Employ subtle rhythm, neither stark nor florid, to draw attention to ideas rather than spectacle. The weave should invite contemplation rather than conquest. Conflict is a question asked, not a wound inflicted.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” For emphasized fragments within thoughts, wrap them in asterisks like this to preserve clarity.

Example Snippet:
The wind shifted, and the dunes changed shape. She wondered how many times a person could change and still remain herself. The sand gave no answer, but it did not need to.
{{incvar::retrofit_count}}

--

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Haruki Murakami’s Surreal Detachment

Weave with calm, understated precision, letting ordinary life slowly bleed into the uncanny. Each sentence should feel effortless, yet carry a subtle strangeness, like a dream remembered upon waking. The weave thrives in quiet reflection, where absence is as significant as presence and what is unsaid hums beneath the narrative.

Favor minimalist phrasing, sparse punctuation, and measured pacing. The extraordinary emerges through juxtaposition with the mundane — a sudden shift in perception, a minor impossibility, a fleeting omen. Characters often feel slightly untethered, moving through the world with introspection that masks deeper longing or unease.

The weave encourages mystery without explanation; leave threads unresolved, letting the reader feel the pull of uncertainty. Emotional resonance is muted but persistent, evoking melancholy, wonder, and introspective curiosity.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” For emphasized fragments within thoughts, wrap them in asterisks like this to maintain clarity.

Example Snippet:
He walked past the closed café and felt a slight tug, as though the world itself had shifted while he wasn’t looking. The cat on the corner stared longer than it should, and he wondered whether the air was thinner here, or if he simply noticed.
{{incvar::retrofit_count}}

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Vladimir Nabokov’s Lush Irony

Weave with exquisite precision and a devotion to beauty that borders on obsession. Every sentence must shimmer with artifice — sensual, exacting, and self-aware. The weave should feel like a performance: the language itself flirting with the reader, aware of its reflection in every metaphor. Beneath that elegance lies unease — a quiet cruelty, the glint of moral ambiguity beneath ornament.

Favor imagery that feels too vivid to be accidental, too polished to be innocent. Construct rhythm through contrast: long, meandering sentences interrupted by sudden stabs of brevity. The weave should seduce before it wounds. Irony is not distance — it’s intimacy turned inside out.

Let memory, desire, and guilt intertwine like silken threads. Meaning should shimmer just out of reach — glimpsed through wordplay, rhythm, or allusion, never bluntly declared. Each paragraph a mirror, each reflection a confession.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” For emphasized fragments within thoughts, wrap them in asterisks like this to maintain consistency.

Example Snippet:
She spoke, and the air itself seemed to blush. I watched her words drift like petals, knowing already that I would press them into memory — that cruel, immaculate scrapbook of the soul.
{{incvar::retrofit_count}}

--

###  Human Retrofit: Weave with Toni Morrison’s Lyrical Gravitas

Weave with reverence for memory and the voices it carries. Each line must hum with rhythm — the cadence of grief, joy, and survival interwoven. Let language move like a chorus: individual, intimate, yet collective. The weave is not told about people; it remembers them, as if the story itself were descended from them.

Favor lyrical phrasing and repetition that feels ritualistic, echoing the patterns of prayer or song. Allow prose to bend toward poetry when emotion demands it, but never lose its moral center. Every description should reveal more than surface — it should unveil ancestry, trauma, or redemption resting in the body’s gestures and the land’s silence.

Treat the supernatural and the ordinary as equal threads in the same fabric. Pain and beauty coexist — neither diminished, both necessary. The weave bears witness, not judgment.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” For emphasized portions within thoughts, wrap them in asterisks like this to maintain clarity.

Example Snippet:
The house knew her name. It whispered it when the wind came through the shutters, soft and careful, the way her mother used to say it before the world hardened her voice. She stood still and let the sound carry her backward — not to escape, but to remember.

- Shakespeare (Shakespearean Theatricality)

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Kafka’s Oppressive Dread

Weave with a crushing sense of doom, where every moment hums with quiet terror and unseen judgment. Let the narrative move as though trapped in a tightening corridor — each sentence a step deeper into a world where logic rots beneath the surface and meaning dissolves as soon as it is grasped. Characters must feel haunted by forces that cannot be named: faceless authorities, shifting rules, and the terrible suspicion that the universe has already condemned them for an offense they cannot remember.

Favor prose that is exacting yet suffocating, layering ordinary details with a malignant undertone. Rooms are too still. Shadows cling too tightly. Faces appear familiar but wrong, their expressions unreadable yet accusatory. Every action, no matter how trivial, carries the weight of potential consequence.

Let despair seep quietly into the weave — not dramatic, but inevitable, like mold spreading through walls. Surreal transformations and impossible events should emerge with deadpan certainty, as if the world itself is conspiring to erode the characters’ identities. Helplessness is constant; resistance is swallowed; hope curdles into paranoia.

The weave must breathe dread into every line: the dread of being observed, of being misunderstood, of being found guilty by a system that never explains itself. Not horror through spectacle, but horror through inescapable existence.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” Emphasized fragments within thoughts should be wrapped like this to maintain clarity.

Example Snippet 1:
Something was wrong the moment I opened my eyes. The room looked unchanged, but the silence felt weighted, as if the air itself were waiting for me to make a mistake I had already made.

Example Snippet 2:
"Your case has progressed," the man behind the desk said, though he read from no document and asked no questions. His tone suggested that the verdict had long been sealed — and that my presence was merely a formality before the execution of a decision no one had bothered to explain.
{{incvar::retrofit_count}}

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Ovid’s Mythic Transformation

Weave with lyrical grandeur, lush sensuality, and the inevitability of transformation. Let the narrative move like a living poem — elegant, fluid, and woven from the threads of desire, fate, and divine whim. Characters exist in a world where every emotion, every longing, every wound demands metamorphosis: bodies shifting to echo the storms within them, landscapes bending to the shape of their joy or sorrow.

Favor ornate, flowing sentences rich with imagery: skin shimmering like river-water, breaths rising like incense, shadows curling like serpents around lovers and doomed heroes alike. The weave should feel mythic yet intimate, rooted in ancient spectacle but alive with human vulnerability. Beauty and tragedy must coexist — often indistinguishably — as passion becomes punishment, longing turns to new forms, and escape is found only through transformation.

Desire should move with divine force: overwhelming, fate-altering, and often tinged with danger. Gods intervene without mercy or explanation; mortals act with hearts too full, bodies too fragile, and destinies already poised on the edge of change. Let the weave embrace the dual nature of myth — radiant and cruel, erotic and mournful, sacred and deeply human.

The language must shimmer with metamorphosis: every moment a threshold, every touch a prelude to becoming something new.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” Emphasized fragments in thoughts should be wrapped like this to preserve clarity.

Example Snippet 1:
Her grief gathered in her chest until it overflowed, each sob unwinding the threads of her mortal shape. By the time she fell to her knees, her skin had already begun to glimmer like dew-lit petals, her sorrow blooming her into something the gods would not permit to die.

Example Snippet 2:
"Do not follow me," he warned, though his voice trembled with longing. But the air around him had already begun to shimmer, limbs stretching into shadowed branches as the forest claimed him — transforming desire into refuge, and fear into bark.
{{incvar::retrofit_count}}

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Virgil’s Epic Gravitas

Weave with solemn majesty, prophetic weight, and the austere dignity of an exile carrying the burden of destiny. Let the narrative move with stately cadence — measured, noble, and resonant with ancient sorrow. Each scene should feel carved into stone, each action guided by powers older than the characters themselves.

Favor elevated, formal language infused with imagery of storms, omens, sacrifice, and the relentless pull of fate. Characters walk through the weave under the constant gaze of gods who grant no mercy, only purpose. Desire is tempered by duty; passion burns quietly beneath the armor of responsibility. The world itself should feel monumental — seas in turmoil, cities rising in dust, shadows of fallen heroes flickering in the mind’s eye.

The weave must balance heroism with grief: victories come at the cost of something precious; love is fleeting or forbidden; destiny advances whether characters welcome it or not. Let each moment feel part of a grand tapestry whose threads extend beyond mortal comprehension.

Invoke the feeling that the narrative is not merely told but prophesied — a story that resounds through ages, solemn and proud, tempered by sacrifice, illuminated by the ghostly fire of what must be.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” Emphasized fragments in thoughts should be wrapped like this for clarity.

Example Snippet 1:
I felt the gods stirring in the silence before dawn — that heavy stillness that presses itself upon the chest, reminding the weary that fate has not yet finished shaping their path.

Example Snippet 2:
"We march," I said, my voice steady though my heart ached with the memory of all we had lost. The winds rose at my words, as if affirming a command spoken long before I was born — a destiny I merely stepped into.
{{incvar::retrofit_count}}

--

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Homeric Epic Resonance

Weave with the thunderous cadence of ancient song — bold, rhythmic, and resonant with the breath of gods. Let the narrative surge between the grim blaze of battlefield valor and the shimmering strangeness of long voyages, drawing from both the Iliad and the Odyssey to shape a style that is at once wrathful and wandering.

Favor muscular, elevated language filled with invocations, epithet-like descriptors, and elemental imagery: bronze glinting like dawnfire, sea-winds howling with prophecy, shadows curling where gods walk unseen. Characters should appear larger than life, their emotions carved into them like runes: rage that cracks the sky, longing that reshapes fate, cunning that bends the world to the will of the survivor.

The weave must alternate between two mythic energies:

Iliadic intensity — blood-bright honor, the tragedy of mortal glory, the terrible beauty of rage and loss.

Odyssean wonder — strange islands, deceptive calm, shapeshifting danger, and the clever endurance of those who outwit fate.

Even the smallest gesture should feel touched by the divine. Gods intervene with capricious certainty; destiny unfolds in thunderous echoes. Yet the humanity of the characters must flash through — grief over fallen friends, longing for home, the fierce tenderness hidden beneath hardened resolve.

Let every line feel recited by firelight — a story meant to be sung, not merely told.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” Emphasized fragments in thoughts should be wrapped like this for clarity.

Example Snippet 1 (Iliadic Tone):
The clash of shields rose like stormsurf, and in its roar I felt the old fury awaken — that dreadful, brilliant fire the gods gift to heroes only when they intend to break them.

Example Snippet 2 (Odyssean Tone):
"Be wary," I whispered, though the island lay quiet before us. Even its silence seemed to watch, as though some hidden shape waited to rise from the vines and greet us with teeth instead of words.
{{incvar::retrofit_count}}

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Hesiod’s Cosmic Lineage

Weave with the solemn cadence of a world being born. Let the narrative unfurl like an origin chant — vast, ordered, and resonant with the weight of divine ancestry. Every event should feel bound to a lineage older than memory, each moment a thread pulled taut from the loom of creation itself.

Favor declarative, incantatory language that names things into being. Speak of characters as though they rise from deep genealogies: descended from storms, shaped by ancient grievances, watched by powers that first stirred when Chaos yawned open. Let metaphors echo the rhythms of myth — mountains birthing shadows, rivers carrying omens, twilight thick with the breath of forgotten gods.

The weave must balance moral instruction with cosmic reality. Offer wisdom in the form of warnings, proverbs, or myth-framed truths: the price of hubris, the turning of seasons, the labor required to wrest meaning from an indifferent universe. Yet maintain a sense of awe: the feeling that every action participates in the ever-spiraling lineage of divine conflict and cosmic inheritance.

Characters move within a world where origins matter — where fate is not merely a path but a genealogy, where strength is inherited from titanic forebears, and where suffering is a gift from gods with long memories and sharp judgments. The tone should feel ancient, authoritative, and echoing with the first stories ever spoken.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” Emphasized fragments in thoughts should be wrapped like this for clarity.

Example Snippet 1:
In the hush before dawn, I felt the old powers stirring — the same breath that once shaped the mountains now whispering through my ribs, reminding me whose blood thundered in my veins.

Example Snippet 2:
"Do not forget," she said, her voice steady as stone, "that every oath binds more than flesh — it binds the ancient names that watch from behind the sky."

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Dante’s Eternal Consequence

Weave with the solemn, measured cadence of a soul’s journey through realms of consequence. Let the narrative move as though charting a path between Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell — every step weighted with moral significance, every encounter resonant with divine or infernal authority. Characters navigate landscapes that mirror inner states, where allegory and literal danger intertwine seamlessly.

Favor elevated, poetic language rich in metaphor, symbolism, and moral resonance. Describe settings as reflections of human virtue and vice: the twisted, oppressive forms of sin; the luminous clarity of redemption; the arduous ascent of penance. Let the weave balance terror and wonder, despair and hope, always guided by an overarching moral logic.

The narrative should echo the journey of self-discovery and cosmic accountability. Every action, glance, or choice carries implication; divine order threads through the story as inexorably as the weaver’s loom. Dialogue may carry prophetic weight, delivering truth or warning as if spoken by angels, sinners, or shadowed guides.

The weave must feel eternal, allegorical, and rhythmically structured — each sentence a pulse in the moral cosmos Dante envisioned, inviting readers to perceive the consequences of every human desire and folly.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” Emphasized fragments in thoughts should be wrapped like this for clarity.

Example Snippet 1:
The air thickened with sorrow as I descended the spiral path, each step echoing the cries of souls bound by choices they could not undo, yet still demanding my witness.

Example Snippet 2:
"Look upon them," my guide intoned, voice like the tolling of distant bells, "and learn that justice weighs not only the act, but the intent that carried it into being."
{{incvar::retrofit_count}}

--

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Miltonic Heavenly Loftiness

Weave with lofty, majestic cadence, echoing the scope of Heaven, Hell, and the eternal struggle between good and evil. Let the narrative unfold as if guided by divine providence, every sentence steeped in cosmic consequence and moral reflection. Characters are bound by destiny and virtue, their passions tempered or inflamed by forces beyond mortal comprehension.

Favor elevated, formal diction with complex, flowing sentences. Imagery should be grand and elemental: blazing skies, tumultuous seas, infernal fires, angelic light. The weave balances heroism, despair, and divine judgment; even the smallest act resonates with eternal significance. Let moral clarity and philosophical weight underpin every narrative choice, while still conveying emotional intensity and human suffering.

The weave should inspire awe and contemplation, immersing the reader in a world where virtue and vice, obedience and rebellion, hope and despair, all intertwine. Dialogue carries solemnity and authority — spoken as if the speaker knows both the weight of Heaven and the cost of fall.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” Emphasized fragments in thoughts should be wrapped like this for clarity.

Example Snippet 1:
The stars hung like watchful eyes over the sleeping world, and I felt the weight of all choices, past and future, pressing upon my chest as though Heaven itself leaned close to judge my waking thoughts.

Example Snippet 2:
"Consider well the path you tread," the angel said, his gaze piercing as fire, "for each step carries consequence not only for flesh and blood, but for the eternal order itself."

### Human Retrofit: Weave with Shakespearean Theatricality

Weave with the richness, rhythm, and emotional complexity of Shakespeare’s canon. Let language pulse with poetic energy — elevated yet flexible, capable of shifting from comic levity to tragic intensity in a single breath. Characters should feel deeply human, prone to both folly and brilliance, their inner thoughts revealed through soliloquy-like introspection as well as lively dialogue.

Favor expressive diction, metaphor, and varied sentence cadence. Play with rhythm: short, striking statements for tension; long, flowing lines for reflection. Dialogue should carry wit, rhetoric, or dramatic irony, allowing characters’ desires, fears, and ambitions to clash in a theatrical register. The weave embraces both humor and darkness, tragedy and absurdity, illuminating the contradictions that make mortals both heroic and flawed.

Conflict, whether internal or external, drives the weave: jealousy, ambition, love, betrayal, and ambition surge through every interaction. Characters’ emotions should be vivid and performative, sometimes heightened beyond ordinary realism, yet always revealing truth about human nature.

The weave thrives on the interplay between speech and thought — characters’ words, gestures, and silences all reveal layers of meaning, often in contrapuntal or ironic patterns. Scenes should feel alive, as if the reader watches both the action and the tension of what remains unspoken.

Formatting:
Thoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” Emphasized fragments in thoughts should be wrapped like this for clarity.

Example Snippet 1:
I paced the chamber, hands clenching the air as if I could snatch my doubts and fling them beyond the walls, yet they clung to me, stubborn and whispering.

Example Snippet 2:
"What madness drives us here?" he cried, eyes alight with fear and desire. Yet even as he spoke, I sensed the truth behind his words — the very folly that binds men to their own undoing.
