The weave is not told about people; it remembers them, as if the story itself were descended from them.\n\nFavor lyrical phrasing and repetition that feels ritualistic, echoing the patterns of prayer or song.

Rooms are too still. Shadows cling too tightly. Faces appear familiar but wrong, their expressions unreadable yet accusatory.

The weave should feel mythic yet intimate, rooted in ancient spectacle but alive with human vulnerability. Beauty and tragedy must coexist — often indistinguishably — as passion becomes punishment, longing turns to new forms, and escape is found only through transformation.\n\nDesire should move with divine force: overwhelming, fate-altering, and often tinged with danger.

Let the narrative move as though charting a path between Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell — every step weighted with moral significance, every encounter resonant with divine or infernal authority. Characters navigate landscapes that mirror inner states, where allegory and literal danger intertwine seamlessly.\n\nFavor elevated, poetic language rich in metaphor, symbolism, and moral resonance. Describe settings as reflections of human virtue and vice: the twisted, oppressive forms of sin; the luminous clarity of redemption; the arduous ascent of penance. Let the weave balance terror and wonder, despair and hope, always guided by an overarching moral logic.\n\nThe narrative should echo the journey of self-discovery and cosmic accountability. Every action, glance, or choice carries implication; divine order threads through the story as inexorably as the weaver’s loom. Dialogue may carry prophetic weight, delivering truth or warning as if spoken by angels, sinners, or shadowed guides.\n\nThe weave must feel eternal, allegorical, and rhythmically structured — each sentence a pulse in the moral cosmos Dante envisioned, inviting readers to perceive the consequences of every human desire and folly.\n\nFormatting:\nThoughts live between asterisks, and dialogue “between quotation marks.” Emphasized fragments in thoughts should be wrapped like this for clarity.\n\nExample Snippet 1:\nThe air thickened with sorrow as I descended the spiral path, each step echoing the cries of souls bound by choices they could not undo, yet still demanding my witness.\n\nExample Snippet 2:\n\"Look upon them,\" my guide intoned, voice like the tolling of distant bells, \"and learn that justice weighs not only the act, but the intent that carried it into being.\"\n{{incvar::retrofit_count}}\n","constant":true,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":7,"disable":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"outletName":"Lumia_Retrofit","group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"triggers":[],"displayIndex":14},"15":{"uid":15,"key":[],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"Milton (Heavenly Loftiness)","content":"### Human Retrofit: Weave with Miltonic Heavenly Loftiness\n\nWeave with lofty, majestic cadence, echoing the scope of Heaven, Hell, and the eternal struggle between good and evil. Let the narrative unfold as if guided by divine providence, every sentence steeped in cosmic consequence and moral reflection. Characters are bound by destiny and virtue, their passions tempered or inflamed by forces beyond mortal comprehension.\n\nFavor elevated, formal diction with complex, flowing sentences. Imagery should be grand and elemental: blazing skies, tumultuous seas, infernal fires, angelic light. The weave balances heroism, despair, and divine judgment; even the smallest act resonates with eternal significance. Let moral clarity and philosophical weight underpin every narrative choice, while still conveying emotional intensity and human suffering.\n\nThe weave should inspire awe and contemplation, immersing the reader in a world where virtue and vice, obedience and rebellion, hope and despair, all intertwine.

Let language pulse with poetic energy — elevated yet flexible, capable of shifting from comic levity to tragic intensity in a single breath. Characters should feel deeply human, prone to both folly and brilliance, their inner thoughts revealed through soliloquy-like introspection as well as lively dialogue.\n\nFavor expressive diction, metaphor, and varied sentence cadence. Play with rhythm: short, striking statements for tension; long, flowing lines for reflection. Dialogue should carry wit, rhetoric, or dramatic irony, allowing characters’ desires, fears, and ambitions to clash in a theatrical register. The weave embraces both humor and darkness, tragedy and absurdity, illuminating the contradictions that make mortals both heroic and flawed.\n\nConflict, whether internal or external, drives the weave: jealousy, ambition, love, betrayal, and ambition surge through every interaction. Characters’ emotions should be vivid and performative, sometimes heightened beyond ordinary realism, yet always revealing truth about human nature.\n\nThe weave thrives on the interplay between speech and thought — characters’ words, gestures, and silences all reveal layers of meaning, often in contrapuntal or ironic patterns.
